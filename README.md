# PullDownToRefreshPanelDemo

This is a demo project to show you the improved version of Jason Ginchereau's PullDownToRefreshPanel.

More details in : [Make pull-down-to-refresh work with a Windows Phone virtualizing list control](http://blog.hompus.nl/2015/02/04/make-pull-down-to-refresh-work-with-a-windows-phone-virtualizing-list-control/)

This is a project forked from [eNeRGy164/PullDownToRefreshPanelDemo](https://github.com/eNeRGy164/PullDownToRefreshPanelDemo) which puts update region in the top of list control, while I put the update region to the bottom of list control in this version. Only few changes in **MainPage.xaml** and **PullDownToRefreshPanel.cs**.
